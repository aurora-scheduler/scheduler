- Updated SpotBugs to 4.2.0
- Updated Commons to 3.10
- Updated Guice to 4.2.3
- Improved the way Updates handle paused/resumed updates where instance updates previously
  failed. Previously, upon resuming a paused update, previously failed updates would be retried.
  This would make updates take longer than expected, specifically when using the auto-pause
  mechanism.
- Modified auto-pause mechanism to address a corner case where the status of an instance in a batch
  would not enter a terminal state before the batch was paused. This resulted in undesired behavior
  when the updated was resumed if that instance update had failed.
- Auto-pause update mechanism now makes sure all instances have entered a terminal state
  [SUCCEDED, FAILED] before pausing the update. With this change, the final pause to
  acknowledge an update had sucessfully completed has also been dropped.
- Support has been added to use a resource with the key ips from Mesos.
